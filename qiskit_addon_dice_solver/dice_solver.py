    Approximate the ground state of a molecular Hamiltonian using the heat bath configuration interaction method.

    In order to leverage the multi-processing nature of this tool, the user must specify
    the CPU resources to use via the `mpirun_options` argument.

    For example, to use 8 CPU slots in parallel in quiet mode:

    .. code-block:: python

       # Run 8 parallel slots in quiet mode
       mpirun_opts = "-quiet -n 8"
       # OR
       mpirun_opts = ["-quiet", "-n", "8"]

       energy, sci_coeffs, sci_strings, avg_occs = solve_hci(..., mpirun_options=mpirun_opts)

    For more information on the ``mpirun`` command line options, refer to the `man page <https://www.open-mpi.org/doc/current/man1/mpirun.1.php>`_.

    .. note::

       Only closed-shell systems are supported. The particle number for both
       spin-up and spin-down determinants is expected to be equal.

    .. note::

       Determinants are interpreted by the ``Dice`` command line application as 16-byte unsigned integers; therefore, only systems
       of ``128`` or fewer orbitals are supported.

    Args:
        hcore: Core Hamiltonian matrix representing single-electron integrals.
        eri: Electronic repulsion integrals representing two-electron integrals.
        norb: The number of spatial orbitals.
        nelec: The numbers of spin up and spin down electrons.
        ci_strs: CI strings specifying the subspace to use at the beginning of the first HCI iteration.
            Should be specified as a pair of lists, with the first list containing the alpha strings and the
            second list containing the beta strings. If not specified, only the Hartree-Fock string will be used.
            A CI string is specified as an integer whose binary expansion encodes the string. For example,
            the Hartree-Fock string with 3 electrons in 5 orbitals is `0b00111`.
        spin_sq: Target value for the total spin squared for the ground state. If ``None``, no spin will be imposed.
        select_cutoff: Cutoff threshold for retaining state vector coefficients.
        energy_tol: Energy floating point tolerance.
        max_iter: The maximum number of HCI iterations to perform.
        mpirun_options: Options controlling the CPU resource allocation for the ``Dice`` command line application.
            These command-line options will be passed directly to the ``mpirun`` command line application during
            invocation of ``Dice``. These may be formatted as a ``Sequence`` of strings or a single string. If a ``Sequence``,
            the elements will be combined into a single, space-delimited string and passed to
            ``mpirun``. If the input is a single string, it will be passed to ``mpirun`` as-is. If no
            ``mpirun_options`` are provided by the user, ``Dice`` will run on a single MPI slot. For more
            information on the ``mpirun`` command line options, refer to the `man page <https://www.open-mpi.org/doc/current/man1/mpirun.1.php>`_.
        temp_dir: An absolute path to a directory for storing temporary files. If not provided, the
            system temporary files directory will be used.
        clean_temp_dir: Whether to delete intermediate files generated by the ``Dice`` command line application.
            These files will be stored in a directory created inside ``temp_dir``. If ``False``, then
            this directory will be preserved.

        - Minimum energy from SCI calculation
