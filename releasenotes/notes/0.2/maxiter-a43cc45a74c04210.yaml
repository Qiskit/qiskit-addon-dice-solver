upgrade:
  - |
    The ``max_davidson`` keyword argument to :func:`qiskit_addon_dice_solver.solve_dice` has been renamed to ``max_iter`` to better reflect its functionality. The number of Davidson cycles performed at each HCI iteration is hard-coded in the ``Dice`` command line function. This argument controls the number of HCI iterations performed on top of the Davidson diagonalization.

    To upgrade, change this code

    .. code-block:: python

        from qiskit_addon_dice_solver import solve_dice

        energy, coeffs, occs = solve_dice(..., max_davidson=N)

    ... to this

    .. code-block:: python

        from qiskit_addon_dice_solver import solve_dice

        energy, coeffs, occs = solve_dice(..., max_iter=N)
