    Open shell systems are now supported in :func:`qiskit_addon_dice_solver.solve_fermion` by setting the ``open_shell`` keyword argument to ``True``. If set to ``True``, the left and right halves of the input bitstrings may contain different hamming weights.

    Open shell systems are also supported in :func:`qiskit_addon_dice_solver.solve_hci`. Alpha and beta determinants are no longer expected to have the same hamming weights.
